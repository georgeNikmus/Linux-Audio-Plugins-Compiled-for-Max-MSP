Linux4Max library consists of the translations of some high quality plugins(mainly for dynamic processing and physical modeling) 
that I have initially used on a linux audio setup. This collection of plugins derive from various developers: Faust library, Fons Andriaensen's plugins, Robin Gareus' plugins(with multichannel capabilities),K.S.Matheussen's radium compressor (with multichannel capabilities),and Zam plugins.
The binaries only work for Windows, but I have included the source code if you wish to compile them for Mac.
Welcome for corrections and other contributions if you are interested.
