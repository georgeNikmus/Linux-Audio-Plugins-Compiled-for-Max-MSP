Linux4Max library consists of the translations of some high quality plugins(mainly for dynamic processing and physical modeling) 
that I have initially used on a linux audio setup. This collection of plugins derive from various developers: Faust library, Fons Andriaensen's plugins, Robin Gareus' plugins,K.S.Matheussen's radium compressor,and Zam plugins.
